This assignment is not completed.
However, it will work for some discrete log.

There are many bugs and code poorly written. 

I planning on refactoring the entire project.

My current goals:

1) to implement segmented sieve of eratosthenes 
because sieve of eratosthenes uses more memory than my 8GB pc can throw at it. 

2) A fast pollard rho second on my list

3) a lot refactoring and code organization
